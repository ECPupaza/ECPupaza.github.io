We examine patterns of migration and far-right voting in London following the Eastern enlargement of the European Union in 2004 and 2007. We show that the distribution of migrants from this region is linked to pre-existing transport infrastructure providing access to low-cost flights back home. Combining ward-level election and census data with geo-referenced information on bus stops serving relevant airports, our instrumental variable approach addresses immigrant sorting and reveals a large positive effect on changes in support for far-right anti-immigrant parties between the 2004 and 2012 London elections. Our approach expands the methodological toolkit for studying the effects of migration. The findings challenge claims of low-cost airlines \u0026ldquo;bringing the EU closer together\u0026rdquo; and have policy implications based on the spatial predictability we uncover.\n","date":1614470400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614470400,"objectID":"3ff45b41a80ef15cdce71310f49368be","permalink":"/post/transport/","publishdate":"2021-02-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/transport/","section":"post","summary":"Hypermobility and the Rise of Far-Right Parties","tags":[],"title":"Low-Cost Flights and Far-Right Votes","type":"post"},{"authors":["Elena C.

Since migrants are not evenly distributed geographically, the sudden surge in applications for British citizenship in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum could mean that, in certain geographic areas, the median voter profile may match the profile of an immigrant. Thus, if the new citizens become active voters, a new electoral map could emerge; one where urban constituencies become even more salient in politics, and where new political entrepreneurs will start targeting this previously unenfranchised group. Studying the political socialisation trajectories of individuals who join the electorate by naturalisation is a key component in understanding the political behaviour of social change and making better electoral predictions. The paper identifies the most prevalent socio-economic characteristics of successful applicants for British citizenship and connects them with the corresponding voting behaviour literature and survey data in other to develop hypothesis about their political preferences and their participation in future elections.\n","date":1614470400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614470400,"objectID":"3417ef5dae24ffb565201f2a38470dc9","permalink":"/post/citizenship/","publishdate":"2021-02-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/citizenship/","section":"post","summary":"The Impact of the Referendum to Leave the EU on Citizenship Applications","tags":[],"title":"The Citizenship Market in Post-Brexit Britain","type":"post"},{"authors":["Elena C.

This paper focuses on prospective and retrospective evaluations of changes in the State Pension Age (SPA) in the United Kingdom. Combining secure-level panel data from two national household surveys with administrative data, and applying a difference in differences research design, I analyse the variation in political preferences before and after (a) the implementation of the policy and (b) the time when voters receive written notification of the policy change (15 years later). I find that in the immediate aftermath of the reform, affected voters became more disillusioned with politics and slightly more more empathetic towards smaller parties. Surprisingly, the notification treatment has no effect on political preferences although there are still some weak effects on political disillusionment. The findings are of particular relevance to understanding how policy-makers communicate with the public and how the public responds to policies that have long-term implications.\n","date":1549324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567641600,"objectID":"3716306ba5258499a83ca602a205e7df","permalink":"/post/accountability/","publishdate":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/accountability/","section":"post","summary":"The Electoral Consequences of Pension Reform in the UK","tags":[],"title":"Accountability and Time Lags","type":"post"}]
